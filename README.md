# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio, a collection of real-world projects demonstrating my skills in Power BI, data modeling, DAX, Power Query, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.
This portfolio reflects my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

# 🔍 What This Portfolio Demonstrates

• Collect and clean data from multiple sources

• Model data using star-schema design and relational structures

• Use Power Query for transformation and ETL processes

• Build DAX measures for KPIs, calculations, and time intelligence

• Create interactive dashboards that highlight business insights

• Communicate results clearly through visual storytelling

Each project focuses on a real-world scenario where I applied analytical thinking to identify trends, solve business problems, and deliver actionable recommendations.
