# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio, a collection of real-world projects demonstrating my skills in Power BI, data modeling, DAX, Power Query, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.
This portfolio reflects my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

# 🔍 What This Portfolio Demonstrates

Through these projects, I showcase my ability to:

Collect and clean data from multiple sources

Model data using star-schema design and relational structures

Use Power Query for transformation and ETL processes

Build DAX measures for KPIs, calculations, and time intelligence

Create interactive dashboards that highlight business insights

Communicate results clearly through visual storytelling

Each project focuses on a real-world scenario where I applied analytical thinking to identify trends, solve business problems, and deliver actionable recommendations.
